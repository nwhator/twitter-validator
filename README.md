# C Coding Challenge - Twitter Tweet Validation
This coding challenge requires you to write a C program that validates tweets based on specific requirements.

## Challenge Description
The program should read a tweet from the user and validate it based on the following criteria:

The tweet must be 280 characters or less.
The tweet must not contain any invalid characters.
The tweet must not contain any "@" mentions.
The tweet must not contain any URLs or emails.
If the tweet satisfies all the above criteria, the program should output "Valid tweet." Otherwise, the program should output "Invalid tweet."

## Deliverables
You should submit the following files as part of your solution:

A C program that implements the tweet validation logic described above.
A README file that provides instructions on how to compile and run the program.

## Additional Notes
You can assume that the tweet is entered by the user as a single line of text.
You can assume that the tweet contains only ASCII characters.
You are free to use any standard C library functions for string manipulation.

# Conclusion, 
This C coding challenge aims to test your skills in implementing a tweet validation program. You are required to ensure that the tweet satisfies the given criteria before validating it. This task will help you improve your string manipulation skills and enhance your problem-solving abilities. Once you have completed the task, submit your solution by uploading the required files to a GitHub repository and sharing the link with the person who assigned you this task. Remember to provide clear instructions on how to compile and run your program. Good luck!
